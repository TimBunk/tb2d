## About tb2d

tb2d is a framework that is using box2D and openGL. It is still a work in progress, but so far so good.

## Compiling

You can use cmake to create the project files.

I have only tested my framework on codeblocks on ubuntu, so if you are using something else there is no guarentee it will work.
Also you will need to install the sdl2 package by running this command in the terminal "sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev".
On arch linux you need to install other sdl2 packages too, You can run "sudo pacman -S sdl2 sdl2_image sdl2_ttf sdl2_mixer"

## Documentation

Documentation will be added soon using doxygen.
