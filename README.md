## About tb2d

tb2d is a framework that is using box2D and openGL. It is still a work in progress, but so far so good.

## Compiling

You can use cmake to create the project files.

I have only tested my framework on codeblocks on ubuntu, so if you are using something else there is no guarentee it will work.
Also you will need to install the sdl2 package by running this command in the terminal "sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev".

## Documentation

Documentation will be added soon using doxygen.
