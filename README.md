## About tbfw

tb2d is a framework that is using box2D and openGL. It is still a work in progress, but so far so good.

## Compiling

You can use cmake to create the project files.

I have only tested my framework on visual studio 2017 on a windows machine, so if you are using something else there is no guarentee it will work.

## Documentation

Documentation will be added soon using doxygen.
