## About tb2d

tb2d is a basic framework that is used for making 2D games. It is still a work in progress, but so far so good.

## Compiling

You can use cmake to create the project files.

I have only tested my framework on windows 10 with visual studio 2017. So if you are using something else there is no guarantee it will work.

## Documentation

Documentation is coming soon with doxygen.
